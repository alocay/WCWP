What Could We Play? (WCWP)

A very basic project (mainly as a personal test bed/learning tool for PHP). The main idea was to use the Steam APIs to gather information about 
the games that you and another friend(s) own to determine what the two of you could play together.

To run, download XAMPP, place the project contents in its own directory under [XAMPP directory]/htdocs, and start the Apache server. Navigating to `localhost/[directory]` should do the trick.
  
**Note:** The domain name needs to be changed in the `settings.php` under the `steamauth` directory.

Demo coming eventually.
